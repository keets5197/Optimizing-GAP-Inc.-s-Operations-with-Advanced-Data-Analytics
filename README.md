## Insights

### Regression Model

The regression model aimed to predict best-seller hoodie rankings on Amazon based on average rating, review count, and price.

**Equation:** 
\[ \text{Rank} = 10.9328 \times \text{Average Rating} - 0.0017 \times \text{Review Count} + 0.3059 \times \text{Price} \]

- R-squared value: 0.829, indicating that 82.9% of the variation in the dependent variable 'Rank' can be explained by the independent variables.

### Customer Feedback Analysis

**Platforms:** Trustpilot Reviews for Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic

- **Gap:** Positive reviews highlight quality and shopping experience; negative reviews focus on order processing and customer service.
- **Old Navy:** Frequent mentions of order-related issues and customer service.
- **Banana Republic:** Praised for online shopping experience and specific products; negative feedback on customer service and order issues.

**Key Insights:**
- Addressing low-rated reviews to improve quality, elevate ratings, and boost sales.
- Benchmarking against competitors like J.Crew and Shein for shipping and service features.

### Google Trends Analysis

- **Gap:** Interest is constant but has declined recently.
- **Old Navy:** Search trend decreases over time.
- **Banana Republic:** Trends increase over the past five years.

### Reddit Sentiment and Text Analysis

- Analysis of sentiment and discussions on subreddits relevant to fashion and brand reputation.

## Recommendations

1. **Utilize Negative Feedback:** Leverage insights from negative product reviews to address customer issues and improve products.
2. **Monitor Social Media:** Gauge customer sentiment and understand overall sentiment towards the company.
3. **Google Trends:** Incorporate trends data for strategic planning of discounting strategies and product launches.
4. **Innovative Designs for Banana Republic:** Focus on innovative designs to distinguish itself from competitors.

## Limitations

1. **Scalability:** Limited data sources; expanding data scraping could enhance insights.
2. **Sample Datasets:** Larger datasets from diverse sources could improve accuracy.
3. **Model Optimization:** Current models have room for improvement in complexity and parameter inclusion.

## Conclusion

The case study concludes that while all three brands can benefit from a big data approach, the application and focus might differ based on their target audience, price range, and style. A balanced approach integrating data-driven insights with creative decisions is recommended for optimal results.
